This branch contains code for a convenience wrapper, which starts first the **frozen** backend, then the **frozen** frontend.

## Getting started
To freeze the convenience wrapper, simply run:

```
$ pyinstaller convenience-wrapper.spec
```

This will produce a single executable `DARIAH Topics Explorer` with the DARIAH flower icon in the folder `dist/convenience-wrapper`.
