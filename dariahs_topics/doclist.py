"""
Maintaining Lists of Documents
==============================

A __document list__ manages a list of documents. There are various
implementations of varying powerfulness, all have the following in common:

* A document list keeps a fixed list of documents in order, i.e. after you
  created the list you can call the iteration functions and get the same file
  at the same position (even if, e.g., the underlying directory changes). So
  these files can be matched with lists of document _contents_.

* A document list separates a _base directory_ with some way to form _file
  names_. Thus, you can easily create a mirror (of, e.g., files transformed
  in some way) in a different directory, or modify the way filenames are formed.

        B : Me too
        C : All examples reference themselves

            docs = SimpleDocList('.', filenames=['A','B','C'])

        Now, you have an (external) segmenter function that segments each document
        into segments each being at most two tokens long. The data structure your
        segmenter will produce looks similar to the following:

        record how many segments each document has (A: 3, B: 1, C: 2), and it will
        return a structure flattened by one level as in the following:
