        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This application is designed to introduce topic modeling particularly gently (e.g. for educational purpose).
            If you have a very large text corpus, you may wish to use more <i>powerful</i> tools like <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php">MALLET</a>, which is written in Java and can be completely controlled from the command-line.
            The topic modeling algorithm used in this application, <i>latent Dirichlet allocation</i>, was implemented
            by <a href="https://www.ariddell.org">Allen B. Riddell</a> using collapsed Gibbs sampling as described in <a href="http://www.genetics.org/content/155/2/945.full">Pritchard et al. (2000)</a>.</p>
        <p>You might want to check out some <a href="https://github.com/DARIAH-DE/Topics/tree/master/notebooks">Jupyter notebooks</a> for topic modeling in Python – experimenting with an example corpus on

        <h2>What is DARIAH-DE?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://de.dariah.eu/en">DARIAH-DE</a> supports research in the humanities and cultural sciences with
            digital methods and procedures. The research infrastructure of DARIAH-DE consists of four pillars:
            teaching, research, research data and technical components. As a partner in <a href="https://www.dariah.eu/">DARIAH-EU</a>,
            DARIAH-DE helps to bundle and network state-of-the-art activities of the digital humanities. Scientists use
            DARIAH, for example, to make research data available across Europe. The exchange of knowledge and expertise
            is thus promoted across disciplines and the possibility of discovering new scientific discourses is
            encouraged.</p>
        <p>This application is developed with support from the DARIAH-DE initiative, the German branch of DARIAH-EU,
            the European Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities consortium. Funding has been
            provided by the German Federal Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF) under the identifier 01UG1610A to
            J.</p>
