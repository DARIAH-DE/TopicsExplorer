        <blockquote>Mathematically, the topic model has two goals in explaining the
            documents. First, it wants its topics to place high probability on few terms. Second, it wants to attach documents
            to as few topics as possible. These goals are at odds. With few terms assigned to each topic, the model captures the
            observed words by using more topics per article. With few topics assigned to each article, the model captures the
