        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This application is designed to introduce topic modeling particularly gently (e.g. for educational purpose).
            If you have a very large text corpus, you may wish to use more sophisticated models such as those
            implemented in <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php">MALLET</a>, which is known to be more robust
            than standard LDA. You might want to check out some <a href="https://github.com/DARIAH-DE/Topics/tree/master/notebooks">Jupyter
                notebooks</a> – you can experiment with the example corpus directly in the browser on <a href="#TODO">Binder</a>
            without installing anything.</p>
        <h2>Issues</h2>
        <p>Please use the project’s <a href="https://github.com/DARIAH-DE/TopicsExplorer/issues">issue tracker</a> on
            GitHub, but consider checking out the <a href="https://dariah-de.github.io/TopicsExplorer/#troubleshooting">troubleshooting
                section</a> on the application’s website.</p>

        <h2>What is DARIAH-DE?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://de.dariah.eu">DARIAH-DE</a> supports research in the humanities and cultural sciences with
            digital methods and procedures. The research infrastructure of DARIAH-DE consists of four pillars:
            teaching, research, research data and technical components. As a partner in <a href="https://www.dariah.eu/">DARIAH-EU</a>,
            DARIAH-DE helps to bundle and network state-of-the-art activities of the digital humanities. Scientists use
            DARIAH, for example, to make research data available across Europe. The exchange of knowledge and expertise
            is thus promoted across disciplines and the possibility of discovering new scientific discourses is
            encouraged.</p>
        <p>This application is developed with support from the DARIAH-DE initiative, the German branch of DARIAH-EU,
            the European Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities consortium. Funding has been
            provided by the German Federal Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF) under the identifier 01UG1610A to
            J.</p>
