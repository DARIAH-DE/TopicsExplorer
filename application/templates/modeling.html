		<p>In the meantime you might want to check out some <a href="#">Jupyter notebooks</a>, where the same workflow as in
			this application is explained step by step â€“ but a bit more technically in the programming language Python. This makes
			you more flexible with everything and allows you to use more sophisticated topic models. You can
			experiment with the example corpus directly in the browser on <a href="#">Binder</a> without installing anything.</p>
