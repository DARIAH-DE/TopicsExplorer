        <h1>A total of {{ corpus_size }} documents</h1>
        <p>All documents of your corpus are listed here by their original filename. The longer the bar, the longer the
            text of a document, taking pure word frequencies into account. At best, all documents are about the same
            length. If you have some very large texts, but also very short ones, you should consider splitting the
            large documents into smaller chunks and create a new topic model.</p>
        <p>Explore your text corpus by <b>clicking on the document bars</b> â€“ or select one of the other
            tabs in the above menu.</p>
