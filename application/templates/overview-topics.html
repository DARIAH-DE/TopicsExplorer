        <h1>Topics</h1>
        <p>A topic is a probability distribution over the whole vocabulary of a text corpus. One value is
            assigned to each word, which indicates how <i>relevant</i> the word is to that topic (to be exact, how
            <i>likely</i> one word is to be found in a topic). After sorting those values in descending order, the first <i>n</i>
            words represent a topic.</p>
        <p>The topics are ranked by their <i>numerical dominance</i> in the corpus and display each in a bar with width
            proportional to the topicâ€™s dominance
            score. You can start exploring your topic model by clicking on the topics, or select one of the other tabs
            in the navigation bar above.</p>
        {% for topic, proportion in proportions %}
        <p><a style="width: {{ proportion }}%;" class="main_button" href="{{ url_for('topics', topic=topic) }}">{{

        <blockquote>Mathematically, the topic model has two goals in explaining the
            documents. First, it wants its topics to place high probability on few terms. Second, it wants to attach
            documents
            to as few topics as possible. These goals are at odds. With few terms assigned to each topic, the model
            captures the
            observed words by using more topics per article. With few topics assigned to each article, the model
            captures the
            observed words by using more terms per topic.<footer>
